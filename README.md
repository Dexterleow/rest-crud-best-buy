# Best Buy CRUD REST Inventory Manager
Build a website that manages the product inventory for a Best Buy store.
The store has a list of products which it stores in a JSON file.

We're making a web tool that allows users to view all the products,
view the details of one product, and edit the details of one product.
We'll achieve all of this by implementing a RESTful interface.

## Project Setup
Install all of the project dependencies by running `npm install`. Use
`nodemon index.js` to start the server.
